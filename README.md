Bulletin Board is a web service that serves as an alternative to platforms like Avito. Users can create and browse classified ads, respond to listings, and communicate with sellers. Each ad undergoes pre-moderation by service administrators. Administrators have the ability to return ads for revision, publish them, or move them to the archive.
